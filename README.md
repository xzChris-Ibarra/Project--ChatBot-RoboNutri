ðŸ”¶ Encompassing the learning areas: OOP, Databases, UI/UX, Project Development and PM, I created, backup by my team, the brand: RoboNutri

ðŸ”¸ With the purpose of developing an intelligent and didactic chatbot powered by AI, called RobiNutri, focused on promoting healthy eating habits in children between 8 and 12 years old in the city of Mexicali, Baja California. 

ðŸ”· The virtual assistant will be represented by a friendly mascot called RobiNutri, who will guide the children through an empathetic, playful and educational language about children's nutrition.

ðŸ”º Mexico faces a growing problem of childhood obesity, especially in early childhood. RoboNutri emerges as an innovative tool that uses artificial intelligence and child-centered design to motivate, teach and accompany children in their formation of good eating habits. The project seeks to be not only an academic solution, but also a product with potential for social impact, scalability and commercial value.

ðŸ”» We continue to work on implementing more interfaces and functionalities as we move forward in the school.
